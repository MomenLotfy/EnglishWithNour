He booked a train ticket because <em>when <span class="present">I arrive</span>, <span class="future">I'll text</span> you</em>. Later he smiled and said to a friend: <em>If I <span class="past">won</span> a prize, <span class="would">I would donate</span> some money to the shelter</em>, imagining a better life. That afternoon he remembered an old decision and murmured: <em>If I <span class="pastperfect">had taken</span> that job abroad, <span class="wouldhave">I might have moved</span> to the coast</em>.</p><p class="example">Back at home, Tom found a photo of his brother. He realised: <em>If he <span class="pastperfect">had called</span> earlier, <span class="wouldhave">we would have celebrated</span> together</em>. He also thought about a small chance: <em>If we <span class="present">leave</span> now, <span class="future">we can still make</span> the last ferry</em>. Then he laughed and gave advice to a neighbour: <em>If I <span class="past">were</span> you, <span class="would">I would check</span> the brakes before the trip</em>.</p><p class="example">At dinner his sister warned him: <em>Don't go out unless <span class="present">you need</span> to — if <span class="present">the storm gets</span> worse, <span class="future">we'll stay</span> inside</em>. Later that night, Tom looked back and admitted: <em>If I <span class="pastperfect">hadn't trusted</span> that unreliable app, <span class="wouldhave">I wouldn't have missed</span> the meeting</em>.</p><p class="example">Finally he made a plan: <em>If <span class="present">we keep</span> saving every month, <span class="future">we may be</span> able to buy a small house</em>. He ended the day thinking, <em>If life <span class="past">were</span> simpler, <span class="would">I would worry</span> less</em>.</p><h3>Why this narrative works</h3><ul><li>Sentences with <code>if + <span class="present">present</span></code> + <code><span class="future">will</span> / modal</code> show <strong>real future possibilities</strong> (first conditional).</li><li>Time clauses like <code>when/as soon as</code> use the <span class="present">present</span> in the time clause and <span class="future">future</span> in the main clause.</li><li>Imagined or unlikely situations use the <span class="past">past</span> in the if-clause and <span class="would">would/could/might</span> in the result (second conditional).</li><li>Past regrets or hypothetical past alternatives use the <span class="pastperfect">past perfect</span> and <span class="wouldhave">would/could/might have</span> in the main clause (third conditional).</li></ul></div></body>`;

The condition may or may not happen, but it's possible.</p><div class="example">If you prepare well, you'll succeed in the test.</div><div class="example">If he doesn't message you, let me know right away.</div><div class="example">If you join the training, the project will be easier for you.</div><div class="example">If you support me, I'll finish the work this week.</div><p><strong>Note:</strong> We don't use <em>will</em> in the if-clause.</p><div class="example">❌ I'll call you if you will need help.<br>✔ I'll call you if you need help.</div><h3>Using <em>unless</em></h3><p><strong>Unless</strong> means <em>if not</em>.</p><div class="example">I won't pass the course unless I study harder.<br>= I won't pass the course if I don't study harder.</div><h3>Using <em>in case</em></h3><p>We use <strong>in case</strong> to prepare for a possible situation.

Compare:</p><div class="example">I'll bring an umbrella in case it rains. (=I'll bring it anyway, just to be ready)</div><div class="example">I'll bring an umbrella if it rains. (=I'll only bring it if rain actually happens)</div></section><section><h2>Zero vs First Conditional</h2><p>The <strong>zero conditional</strong> describes general facts or routines.

(specific case)</div></section><section><h2>Future Time Clauses</h2><p>With future time clauses (introduced by <strong>when, as soon as, until, once, before, after, while</strong>), we use a <strong>present tense</strong> (not <em>will</em>) to talk about future events.</p><div class="example">I'll call you as soon as I finish dinner.</div><div class="example">When I turn 30, I'll start my own business.</div><div class="example">I won't leave until you arrive.</div><p>If the time clause comes first, we add a comma.
